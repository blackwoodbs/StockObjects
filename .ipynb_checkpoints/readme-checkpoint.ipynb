    "     An \"exchange\" is a form of market where people can buy and sell stocks, currency, futures, etc. with to goal of making a profit. Trading in volatile markets is ultra-competitive where quick access to information gives a competitive advantage. This advantage is normally described in terms of minimizing risk and maximizing reward. This could mean buying into a stock just as good news breaks or staying away from a stock that is reversing trends. \n",

    "    Technical Analysis is a field of study and belief that market behaviors can be predicted. Some techniques that are used to interpret stock data (or currency, futures, etc.) include simple methods like a moving average, something more complicated such as the MACD (moving average convergence divergence). Candlesticks are a common way of interpreting financial data and provide more information than a line plot. While a line plot gives a single price point for a set period, a candlestick visually provides an open, low, high, and close price for a set period. This allows the interpreter/analyst to get substantially more information. \n",

    "    Candlesticks have been studied as a way to predict future pricing trends for more than 100 years with their origins going back to Japan where they were used to predict rice prices. Many patterns have emerged that users claim can predict trends with high accuracy and this can be leveraged to make a profit when trading. There are many nuances that take a good eye to identify the patterns well/consistently and it takes a true professional to do quickly.\n",

    "    What are candlesticks?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Candlesticks are a visualization tool for trading in financial markets. They provide information about the open, low, high, and close prices over a set period. Since the invention of candlesticks in the 1800's Japanese candlestick patterns has been studied to make predictions about future price actions. Depending on the source there are between 30-100 recognized patterns with an association with the current market sentiment as well as some predictors about price. Candlestick patterns range in complexity and the nuance that typically takes an expert to identify quickly.\n",

    "    Image classification is a technique of assigning some class/label to an image. Machine learning/neural networks are a common way to train and implement a classification model. In this notebook, I will show how to create a simple classification model using TensorFlow and show its performance.\n",

The images folder contains subfolders of the classes I am to identify, in their respective subfolder are ~20 images per class that will be used for training and validation. In the testing_images folder, there are completely unseen images by the model that don’t contain any labels attached to them. Keeping a batch of images separate that can be used as an additional validation step is important to verify that the modeling process doesn't contain significant data leakage.\n",
